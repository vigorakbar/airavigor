      From our first meeting in middle school to reuniting in Singapore, our
      love story has been a journey filled with meaning and depth. Despite
      drifting apart during high school, fate brought us back together. After
      years of sporadic encounters, our last reunion became a turning point in
      our lives. We reconnected and forged a deeper bond.

      2010 - Our Journey Begins: <br />
      It all started in 2010 when we first crossed paths during our junior high
      school days as we went to the same school. We then shared a special
      friendship that laid the foundation for something more.{' '}

      2013 - The Distance: <br />
      We drifted apart during high school days as Vigor moved to another city.
      Although we weren't as close as before, we still managed to keep in touch,
      meeting occasionally over the years.

      2023 - Rekindling the Flame: <br />
      Fast forward to 2023, a decade after our paths diverged. A chance meeting
      reunited us. Fate intervened as we met again, this time in the midst of
      the city's grand array, we rediscovered the connection we once had.
      Something magical sparked between us once again. Though we grew apart, the
      memories of those early years never faded.

      2024 - Sealing Our Fate and Sailing: <br />
      Now, after months of nurturing our rekindled connection, we stand here
      ready to embark on the next chapter of our journey together, creating a
      love story that transcends time and distance.
